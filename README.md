## Getting Started

Create a new React application using the Edge-first Starter Kit:

```sh
bun create edgefirst-dev/starter <my-app>
cd my-app
bun run setup <my-app>
```

The `setup` script will ask for your project name, and other information to configure the project locally and on Cloudflare.

Check the [setup docs](./docs/setup.md) for more information.
