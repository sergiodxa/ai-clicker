# Setup

You can setup the project using the provided `bun run setup` command or manually.

## Automated Setup

To setup the project automatically you can run the following command:

```bash
bun run setup
```

This will ask for a project name, and for a Cloudflare API token with the required permissions.

It will also ask if you have a `GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN` and `VERIFIER_API_KEY` to use in `.dev.vars`.

You can get a new Verifier API key at [verifier.meetchopra.com](https://verifier.meetchopra.com) completely free.

You can get a new Gravatar API token at [gravatar.com/developers](https://gravatar.com/developers/applications) completely free.

> [!TIP]
> If already have `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN` and `VERIFIER_API_KEY` as an environment variable then the setup script won't ask for them and use the already set value.
> The setup script also loads your `.dev.vars` file if it exists as environment variables.

After that it will create the required bindings (D1, KV, R2 and queue), run the migrations and seed against the local database.

Finally it will create a `.dev.vars` file and update the `wrangler.toml` file with the correct values from the created variables.

## Manual Setup

### Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file with the following content:

```txt
APP_ENV="development"

CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=""
CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID=""
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=""

GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN=""

VERIFIER_API_KEY=""
```

Replace the empty strings with the values of your Cloudflare account, database and API token, Gravatar API token and Verifier API key.

You can get a new Verifier API key at [verifier.meetchopra.com](https://verifier.meetchopra.com) completely free.

You can get a new Gravatar API token at [gravatar.com/developers](https://gravatar.com/developers/applications) completely free.

> [!TIP]
> On your Cloudflare Workers environment you will only need `GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN` and `VERIFIER_API_KEY` environment variables.

### The Cloudflare API token should have the following permissions:

- Workers AI:Edit
- D1:Edit
- Workers R2 Storage:Edit
- Workers KV Storage:Edit
- Workers Scripts:Edit

### Create required bindings

You will need to create the following bindings:

```sh
bunx wrangler d1 create <db-name>
bunx wrangler kv namespace create <kv-name>
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create <r2-name>
bunx wrangler queues create <queue-name>
```

Replace the values between `<>` with your desired names, then update the IDs in your wrangler.toml file for the D1 and KV, and the name for the D1 and R2 and queue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't change the binding names, they must be DB, KV and FS as that's what EdgeKit.js expects.

### Run migrations

You will need to run the database migrations, you can do it with

```bash
bun run db:migrate:local db-name
```

Replace `db-name` with your database name configured in `wrangler.toml`.

### Setup GitHub Action Secrets

To deploy using the GitHub Action workflow you will need to setup the following secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_NAME`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

These can be the sames that you used in your `.dev.vars` file.

### Create Cloudflare Secrets

Inside your Cloudflare Workers environment you will need to create the following secrets

- `APP_ENV`
- `GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN`
- `VERIFIER_API_KEY`

You can do it manually on the dashboard or using the `wrangler secret` command.

```bash
bunx wrangler secret put APP_ENV
bunx wrangler secret put GRAVATAR_API_TOKEN
bunx wrangler secret put VERIFIER_API_KEY
```

Set APP_ENV to `production`, and the other two to the values you used in your `.dev.vars` file.
