# Principles

Decisions about the Starter Kit should be guided by the following guiding
principles:

- **Rely on Cloudflare**: Since the whole starter kit is built around Cloudflare Workers, we
  want to leverage as much as possible from the platform, instead of building
  ourself or using third-party services.
- **Minimal Setup:** The starter kit should come with everything ready to go out of the
  box. This means that we should avoid asking users to install a lot of things
  before they can start working on their project, or to configure multiple tools or
  services as much as possible.
- **Only one way:** Avoid providing more than one way to do the same thing. This
  applies to both the pre-configured code and the documentation.
